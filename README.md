# Alien Invasion

The idea of the project originates from the **"Python crash course"** by ***Eric Matthes***, section *Project 1: Alien Invasion*, which, in turn, is a version of the famous game [Space Invaders](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders).
Some elements of the architecture and game logic are taken from the book. But overall, the implementation is quite different from the author's.
Also, as compared to the author's, the functionality and interface are expanded.

The game is implemented using the [Pygame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygame) platform, so its launch requires the installation of this library.

## Game controls:

**F1** - Help

**S** - Start 

**Left / Right** - Ship Movement 

**Space** - Ship Fire

**P** - Pause

**C** - Continue

**Q** - Quit
